# By default, a node will connect to the (TCP, REST and Message Broker - if declared) based on its associated policy.
#
# If a user disables policy-based option (`POLICY_BASED_NETWORKING=false`) then network connectivity is based on information
# in the configuration file.
#
# For policy-based configuration networking will be set as follows:
#   1. A user is able to decide whether the TCP connectivity is set to bind or not. If bind is enabled - then AnyLog
#       will use either the local or overlay IP address.
#        * If an overlay is declared, then the overlay IP address will replace the local IP address
#        * If binding is enabled, then AnyLog will only utilize the local or overlay IP address. Whereas if
#          binding is disabled, the blockchain will use both the external and local (or overlay) IP addresses of the
#          physical machine.
#
#    2. For REST and Message Broker, the (default) binding value is False. This is because data and/or GET requests
#       coming-in may come from machines/devices outside the network.#
#
#    3. Regarding the relation between blockchain policy and AnyLog networking - AnyLog only cares about policy keys `ip`,
#       `local_ip` and port values. All other networking information, such as `proxy_ip` and `external_ip` (if binding is
#       True), are more of an FYI regarding the network configurations of the actual machine.
