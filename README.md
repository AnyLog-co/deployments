# Deploying AnyLog 

AnyLog can be deployed using either a Kubernetes (via Helm) or via Docker. 

For any other deployment format please reach out to us at [info@anylog.co](mailto:info@anylog.co).       

### AnyLog Node Types
* REST - A node that's dedicated deploys an AnyLog instance with only the network connections configured 
* Master - A node that's dedicated to managing the ledger on the blockchain (database)  
* Operator - Node that contains the data generated by devices and sensors
* Publisher - Node to distribute data coming in from different devices and sensors across the different operator nodes 
* Query - Node dedicated to query the data, usually connected to a BI tool, such as Grafana 
* Standalone - An AnyLog instance that consists of both _master_ and _operator_ processes 
* Standalone Publisher - An AnyLog instance that consists of both _master_ and _publisher_ processes 

## Requirements   
* <a href="mailto:info@anylog.co?subject=docker login credentials"> Request Docker login credentials</a> to download AnyLog image  
* [docker-compose](https://github.com/AnyLog-co/documentation/blob/master/Docker%20Compose%20&%20Kubernetes.md)
* [kompose](https://kompose.io/installation/) - A conversion tool for Docker Compose to container orchestrators such as Kubernetes (or OpenShift).
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/) - Kubernetes command line tool
* [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) - local Kubernetes, focusing on making it easy to learn and develop for Kubernetes.
* [helm-charts](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/) - A tool to deploy Kubernetes package

## Directory Structure
[Docker Compose](docker-compose/README.md)
* [AnyLog Node](docker-compose/anylog-node) - Docker deployment the AnyLog docker environment
* [Grafana](docker-compose/grafana) - Docker deployment for Grafana
* [PostgreSQL](docker-compose/postgres) - Docker deployment for Postgres 
* [Remote CLI](docker-compose/remote_cli) - Docker deployment for AnyLog's [Remote-CLI](https://github.com/AnyLog-co/remote-cli)


[Kubernetes Pacakges](helm) - Currently the Kubernetes is setup such that each type of AnyLog instance is in its own directory. 
While this works, we are currently working on updating the package to look and behave in the same way as the Docker packaging.    


## Support 
* [AnyLog Documentation](https://github.com/AnyLog-co/documentation) - documentation for AnyLog  
* [AnyLog API](https://github.com/AnyLog-co/AnyLog-API) - A python package to easily communicate with AnyLog via REST 
* Directions for configuring nginx can be found in the [helm deployment documentation](helm/README.md#configuring-nginx)
